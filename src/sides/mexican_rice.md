## Ingredients

- 1/2 white onion, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 1 Tbs ground cumin
- 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes (or about a cup of passata)
- 1 cup of chicken stock, or more - thin to desired consistency
- 2 cups of jasmine rice
- 1/2 cup of frozen corn
- 1/2 cup of frozen peas
- 1 diced carrot
- 1 whole serrano pepper
- Cilantro
- Salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Blend onion, garlic, cumin, tomatoes, chicken stock and salt in until smooth.
2. Adjust consistency with chicken stock until it is about as thin as a broth.
3. Saute the rice in a little oil until starting to brown.
4. Add around 2 cups of tomato mixture, adjusting to ensure there is enough liquid.
5. Add corn, peas, carrot, serrano pepper (whole, not chopped) and cilantro.
6. Bring to simmer and cover and cook on low for 12 - 15 minutes, or use the
   Fast Slow cooker or Risotto Plus as noted above.
7. Let stand for a few minutes to absorb excess moisture.
8. Remove Cilantro and Serrano pepper and fluff rice.
