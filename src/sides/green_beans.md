## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
- 3 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 pound green beans, stem ends snapped off, beans cut into 2-inch pieces
- Salt and ground black pepper
- ¼ cup water
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

1. Combine butter, garlic, and thyme in small bowl; set aside.
2. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until just smoking.
3. Add beans, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally,
   until spotty brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
4. Add water, cover, and cook until beans are bright green and still crisp,
   about 2 minutes.
5. Remove cover, increase heat to high, and cook until water evaporates,
   30 to 60 seconds.
6. Add butter mixture and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until beans are
   crisp-tender, lightly browned, and beginning to wrinkle, 1 to 3 minutes longer.
7. Transfer beans to serving bowl, toss with lemon juice and parsley;
   adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
