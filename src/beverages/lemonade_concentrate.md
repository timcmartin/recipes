## Ingredients

- 5 lemons, divided
- 3/4 cup (5Â¼ ounces) sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon table salt
- 1 cup hot water

## Directions

1. Select 2 lemons with fewest blemishes and scrub well. Rinse and dry
   thoroughly. Using vegetable peeler, remove zest of washed lemons in strips.
2. Transfer zest to bowl and add sugar and salt. Toss to combine. Using potato
   masher, mash zest, sugar, and salt vigorously until mixture is damp, clumpy,
   and very fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3. Add hot water and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Set aside
   until cool, about 30 minutes. While mixture cools, juice enough lemons to yield
   3/4 cup juice.
4. Stir juice into zest mixture until combined. Strain through fine-mesh strainer
   set over 2-cup liquid measuring cup; discard zest. Refrigerate until chilled,
   at least 1 hour. (If not using concentrate right away, transfer to airtight
   container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.)

### Lemonade

TO MAKE LEMONADE: For single serving, pour 1/2 cup cold water and 1/2 cup
concentrate over ice and stir gently to combine; if necessary, dilute with
additional water to taste.
For 4 servings, fill pitcher with ice, add 2 cups cold water and all of
concentrate, and stir to combine; if necessary, dilute with additional water
to taste. For sparkling lemonade, substitute plain seltzer for cold water.

### Arnold Palmer

1/3 cup of concentrate, 2/3 cup of iced tea, 1/3 of a cup of water or more
dilute to taste.
